 CSE4410 final project (scripts only) - a 2.5D side-scroller platformer using Unity

Unity version:      6000.0.32f1

This game is a side-scroller platformer game in which the goal is to attain the highest score
possible. The player can hurl bowling balls to attack enemies or [?] boxes, and will receive
points for defeating enemies or breaking [?] boxes. The player also has the ability to jump
and can also cancel the jump by releasing the jump button/key early during a jump. The player
has 5 heart points of life maximum and loses one point when taking damage. Defeating an
enemy has a 30% chance to drop one heart recovery item, which the player may use to recover
one heart. The game tracks the player's highest score and allows for resetting this value.
If the player loses all hearts the game ends and the highest score is updated. The current
maximum possible score is approximately 6250 points. There are three levels total.
